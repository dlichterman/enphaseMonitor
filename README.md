# enphaseMonitor

This little project is using a Waveshare 2.9" e-paper display and an ESP32 to pull data from the Enphase API and display my current solar generation, and the day's totals. This is a work in progress and not final quite yet.

Still to be completed is a 3D printed case for the whole thing.
