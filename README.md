# enphaseMonitor

This little project is using a Waveshare 2.9" e-paper display and an ESP32 to pull data from the Enphase API and display my current solar generation, and the day's totals. 

I needed a case for one of the waveshare 2.9" e-paper displays that also had room for an ESP32 inside so I designed the case myself. Waveshare screen link: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P6MJPTD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

This uses M2 screws that came with the screen (or you can use any that you have), and M2 threaded inserts that are heat-set from mcmaster carr: https://www.mcmaster.com/94459A120/

The ESP32 module is held in place with hot glue, as is the cable that I just cut a hole in the side for. ESP module used: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08D5ZD528/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
